# Bash script to forcefully terminate the process named "7-highlander".

# Use the 'pkill' command with the '-SIGKILL' option to send the SIGKILL signal to the process
# whose command line matches the pattern "7-highlander". The '-f' option allows matching
# against the full command line of the process.

# Note: Sending the SIGKILL signal forcefully terminates the process without allowing it to
# perform any cleanup or save its state. Use with caution.

pkill -SIGKILL -f "7-highlander"
